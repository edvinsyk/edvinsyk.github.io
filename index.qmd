I'm a PhD-candidate in Sociology at [SOFI](https://www.su.se/swedish-institute-for-social-research/) at Stockholm University.
My research interest is generally labor market focused, with an emphasis on job quality and working conditions and my thesis concerns the development of job quality in Sweden over the last six decades.
In a first paper I consider the [general development for men and women](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0276562422000725) over time and how this relates to ongoing secular structural trends on the labor market.
In a second forthcoming paper I consider job quality in a career perspective, I look at the intragenerational mobility for different educational groups and by gender.
In a third and final paper I also consider the inequality in several dimensions of job quality for large occupational classes in Europe.

I'm also interested in stratification and inequality, as well as quantitative methods including Bayesian statistics.
