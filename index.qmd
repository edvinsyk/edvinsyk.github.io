I'm a PhD-candidate in Sociology at [SOFI](https://www.su.se/swedish-institute-for-social-research/) at Stockholm University.
My research interest is generally labor market focused, with an emphasis on job quality and working conditions.
In my thesis I have thus far focused on the development of job quality in Sweden over the last six decades.
Both in terms of the [general development for men and women](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0276562422000725) over time and the changes for individuals over the career (forthcoming).

Also interested in quantitative methods including bayesian statistics, as well as stratification and inequality.
