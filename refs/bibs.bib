  abstract = {Skill-upgrading and service expansion are two trends that have characterised labour markets for a long time. What this entails for job quality over the long term is not well understood. This study considers the development of job quality in Sweden between 1968 and 2010. It explores how changes in job quality relate to the occupational structure, compared to within-job changes. Using data from the Level-of-Living-survey a measure of job quality including job complexity, physical work environment, stress and flexibility is constructed. The development is estimated over time and by gender. Regression methods are employed to examine how changes relate to the job distribution. Results show that average job quality has improved for both genders, while variation has decreased. A majority of the increase for women can be explained by changes in the job distribution, while the opposite is true for men.},

  abstract = {This chapter reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on the topics of skill upgrading and service expansion. New employment-based estimates are then provided, including separate estimates for three service categories: (a) human services, (b) market services, and (c) personal services. Empirical trends in skill upgrading within these categories are analyzed. Data used are the Swedish-Level-of-Living (LNU) surveys as well as comparative databases. All estimates are provided using both industry- and occupation-based indicators. Both indicators show similar overall trends, but the former obscures heterogeneity in levels of skill requirements between categories. Findings verify that skill upgrading and service expansion occur steadily over the period 1960s-2010s. For Sweden, a major part of this expansion is driven by growth of the human services. Skill upgrading occurs in all sectors, i.e. is not driven by secular changes in the distribution of employment across sectors, nor by differences in the pace of upgrading between sectors.},
